To translate the given unidiomatic Rust function into idiomatic Rust, we first need to analyze the `unsafe` blocks and the Crown output:

### Unsafe Blocks Analysis

1. **Null Checks**: The function checks if `student` and `newName` are null. In Rust, we can use `Option` to handle the possibility of null values safely.

2. **Dereferencing Pointers**: The function uses `&mut *student` to get a mutable reference to the `Student` struct. In Rust, we can use `Option<&mut Student>` to safely handle this.

3. **Memory Management**: The function uses `malloc` and `free` to manage memory for the `name` field. In Rust, we can use a `Vec<u8>` to handle dynamic memory allocation safely.

4. **String Operations**: The function uses `strlen` and `strcpy` to handle C strings. In Rust, we can use `CStr` to safely convert C strings to Rust byte slices.

### Crown Output Analysis

- `student` is a mutable, owning pointer to a single `Student` object.
- `newName` is a transient, mutable pointer to an array (C string).

### Translation

Based on the analysis, we can translate the function into idiomatic Rust by using safe Rust constructs like `Option`, `Vec<u8>`, and `CStr`. We will also ensure the function name remains unchanged to avoid compilation errors.

Here is the translated function:

----FUNCTION----
```rust
use std::ffi::CStr;

pub fn updateStudentInfo(student: Option<&mut Student>, newName: Option<&CStr>, newAge: i32) {
    if let (Some(student_ref), Some(new_name_cstr)) = (student, newName) {
        // Update the name
        student_ref.name = new_name_cstr.to_bytes().to_vec();

        // Update the age
        student_ref.age = newAge;
    } else {
        println!("Invalid input parameters");
    }
}
```
----END FUNCTION----

This translation uses `Option` to handle potential null values, `CStr` to safely convert C strings, and `Vec<u8>` for dynamic memory management, thus eliminating the need for `unsafe` blocks. The function name is kept as `updateStudentInfo` to match the original signature
