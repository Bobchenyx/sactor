 To translate the provided unidiomatic Rust function into idiomatic Rust, we need to analyze each `unsafe` block and determine if we can replace each unsafe operation with safe Rust equivalents. Given the `Crown` output, we'll translate the pointers accordingly and aim to avoid using pointers in function arguments, as Rust provides safer and more idiomatic approaches.

### Analysis of Unsafe Blocks

1. **Pointer Checks (`is_null`)**:
   - These occur when checking if `student` or `newName` is null. In safe Rust, we can use reference types (`&mut Student` and `&str`). Passing a `&str` will ensure it is not null, and handling `&mut Student` will make sure we do not have to check for null at runtime.

2. **Dereferencing Pointers**:
   - Directly accessing pointer contents (`&mut *student`) is safe in Rust if we start with borrowed references (`&mut`) rather than raw pointers.

3. **Using `libc` functions (`malloc`, `free`, `strlen`, `strcpy`)**:
   - Allocate and manage memory using Rust's ownership and string handling; `String` handles dynamic allocation, and Rust's standard library functions cover string operations safely without requiring manual memory management or the use of `libc`.

### Translation to Safe Rust

Safe Rust offers thread-safety and memory-safety guarantees by leveraging ownership, borrowing, and lifetime concepts. For the translation:

- **Use References Instead of Pointers**:
  - Replace raw pointers with references (`&mut Student` and `&str`) for proper memory safety.

- **String Handling**:
  - Use Rust's `String` type for safe string manipulation.

Here's the translation of the function into idiomatic Rust:

----FUNCTION----
```rust
pub fn updateStudentInfo(student: &mut Student, newName: &str, newAge: i32) {
    if newName.is_empty() {
        println!("Invalid input parameters");
        return;
    }

    student.name = newName.to_owned();
    student.age = newAge;
}
```
----END FUNCTION----

### Explanation

- **Function Signature**:
  - The function takes a mutable reference to a `Student` (`&mut Student`) and a string slice (`&str`). This eliminates the need for raw pointer handling and null checks since Rust enforces validity of references.

- **Checking Input**:
  - Instead of checking if `newName` is null, we check if it's empty, which is safer and prevents invalid operations.

- **Memory Safety**:
  - Reassigning `student.name` with `newName.to_owned()` clones the `str` into a `String`, ensuring memory remains managed by Rust's ownership system. This avoids any manual memory allocation and deallocation.

By following these practices, the provided Rust function now aligns with idiomatic Rust guidelines while safely handling dynamic string and age value changes, all without invoking unsafe code or external libraries for common operations.
